# Module 2: Using Data


In this Module, we introduce the basics of the C# language. Keep in mind that these concepts are the FOUNDATION for all of theother concepts that will be covered in this course so we will take a bit longer to go through this Module.

## A First C# Program

  A method performs a function (in some languages the term function is used, they are interchangeable for the contect of this course); a Method is often referred to as an algorithm;  a class groups function members and data members to form an object-oriented building block. The Console class groups members that handle command-line input/output (I/O) functionality, such as the WriteLine method. A class is a kind of type, which we examine later.
